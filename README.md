# Cloud Cost Governance Engine

Cloud Cost Governance Engine is an AWS-native FinOps and Governance solution that combines predictive scaling and anomaly detection to optimize cloud costs, enforce guardrails, and automate remediation.

---

## Features

- Data Collection  
  - Ingest AWS Cost & Usage Reports (CUR) from S3  
  - Query billing via Cost Explorer API  
  - Pull CloudWatch metrics for resource utilization  

- Machine Learning  
  - Forecast spend and usage trends (Prophet/ARIMA on SageMaker)  
  - Detect anomalies with Isolation Forest / Z-score  
  - Baseline cost thresholds per service/team  

- Governance and Compliance  
  - AWS Budgets and Service Control Policies (SCP)  
  - Policy-as-Code using OPA/Rego  
  - Tagging and allocation enforcement  

- Automation  
  - Predictive scaling for EKS HPA and Auto Scaling Groups  
  - Lambda functions to stop idle EC2/RDS  
  - EventBridge rules for real-time remediation  

- Visibility  
  - Grafana/QuickSight dashboards  
  - Slack/SNS/Email alerts  
  - Weekly cost and usage reports for Finance teams

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with:
  - S3 bucket for CUR exports  
  - IAM roles for Lambda, SageMaker, and RDS  
  - CloudWatch and Cost Explorer enabled  
- Terraform or AWS CDK installed  
- Python 3.9+ environment  

### Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/cloud-cost-governance-engine.git
   cd cloud-cost-governance-engine
````

2. Deploy AWS Infra

   ```bash
   cd infra
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

3. Run Data Collector

   ```bash
   cd collector
   python ingest_cur.py --bucket your-cur-bucket
   ```

4. Train ML Model

   ```bash
   cd ml-engine
   python train_forecast.py
   ```

5. Start Governance Engine

   * Apply OPA/Rego policies
   * Configure AWS Budgets and SCPs
   * Deploy automation Lambdas

## Dashboards and Alerts

* Grafana dashboards for real-time spend and usage
* QuickSight for executive reports
* Alerts via SNS to Slack or Email

---

## Roadmap

* [ ] Multi-cloud (Azure/GCP) integration
* [ ] Kubernetes-native operator for governance
* [ ] Advanced anomaly detection (DeepAR / LSTM)
* [ ] FinOps KPIs dashboard
